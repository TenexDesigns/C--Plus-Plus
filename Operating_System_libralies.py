C++ is used for developing operating systems due to its low-level capabilities, which allow developers to optimize code for speed, efficiency, and resource management. Some libraries used in operating system development include:

Standard Template Library (STL): A part of the C++ standard library that provides generic classes and functions for
  data manipulation, including containers, algorithms, and iterators. STL is useful for implementing data structures
  and algorithms required in operating systems cppstories.com.
  
Boost: A collection of portable, high-quality libraries that extend the functionality of C++ and provide support
  for tasks such as memory management, multithreading, and I/O operations cppstories.com. Website
  
POSIX Threads (Pthreads): A C library that provides an API for creating and managing threads,
  which is often used in operating system development for multithreading support codecademy.com.
  
  
  
  
To start learning about operating system development using C++, you can:

Gain a solid understanding of C++ fundamentals by studying resources like Learn C++ and Cplusplus.com.

Learn about operating system concepts, such as processes, threads, memory management, and file systems.

Books like Operating System Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz and Modern Operating Systems by Andrew S. 
Tanenbaum are great resources.

Practice building small-scale operating system components or projects, such as a basic shell, 
memory allocator, or scheduler.

Study open-source operating systems written in C++ or C, such as ReactOS and FreeRTOS, 
to understand how they are built and organized.

Participate in online forums, communities, and open-source projects related to operating system development 
to learn from experienced developers and contribute to real-world projects.

C++ is indeed used for developing operating systems, particularly for building the kernel and low-level components. 
Here's an overview of how C++ is used in operating system development and some libraries commonly used in this context:

Kernel Development: The core of an operating system, known as the kernel,
  is often written in C or C++ due to their low-level capabilities. C++ allows for object-oriented programming,
  which can help in organizing and managing complex system structures.
  Additionally, C++ provides direct access to hardware resources, memory management, and efficient performance optimizations.

Standard Template Library (STL): The Standard Template Library is a powerful library that provides a collection
  of generic algorithms, containers, and utilities. It includes containers like vectors, lists, and maps,
  algorithms for sorting and searching, and utilities for string manipulation, memory management, and more. 
  The STL is widely used in C++ operating system development for its efficiency and ease of use.

Boost: The Boost library, mentioned earlier, is also relevant in operating system development.
  It offers a wide range of functionalities that can be utilized when building an operating system. 
  Boost.Thread, for example, provides facilities for multithreading, 
  Boost.Asio offers network programming capabilities, and Boost.Filesystem provides file system-related operations.
  These components can be valuable when developing various aspects of an operating system.

Libc: Libc, also known as the C Standard Library, is a library that provides a set of functions and macros specified
  by the C and C++ standards. It includes functionalities like input/output operations, string manipulation,
  memory management, and more. Although primarily a C library, it is often used in C++ operating system development due 
  to its low-level nature and close integration with the operating system.

If youre interested in learning about operating system development using C++, here are some starting points:

Learn C++: Begin by gaining a solid understanding of the C++ programming language.
  Familiarize yourself with its syntax, object-oriented concepts, memory management,
  and standard library features. There are numerous online tutorials, books, and courses available for learning C++.

Understand Operating Systems: Study the fundamentals of operating systems, including processes, threads, 
  memory management, file systems, and system calls. Gain knowledge of how operating systems function and interact with hardware.

Dive into Kernel Development: Explore resources that delve into kernel development using C++. 
  This involves understanding concepts like interrupt handling, context switching, device drivers, 
  and memory management. The Linux kernel source code is a valuable resource for learning about real-world kernel implementation.

Experiment with Simple OS Projects: Start with small-scale operating system projects to gain hands-on experience. 
  For example, you can develop a basic bootloader, build a simple kernel module, or create a simple scheduler. 
  These projects will help solidify your understanding of operating system concepts and provide practical experience.

Explore Open-Source Operating Systems: Study existing open-source operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD, or MINIX. 
  These projects have well-documented codebases and vibrant communities that can help you understand the intricacies
  of real-world operating systems.

Remember that operating system development is a complex and advanced topic.
It requires a deep understanding of computer architecture, systems programming,
and low-level concepts. Starting with smaller projects and gradually progressing towards more 
complex tasks will help you build a strong foundation in operating system development using C++.
